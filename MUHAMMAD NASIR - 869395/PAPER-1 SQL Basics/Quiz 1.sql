--JOINS

---1.  (Easy)  List every order with the customer's full name, store name, and the full name of the staff member who handled it.
SELECT
    o.order_id,
    CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS customer_name,
    s.store_name,
    CONCAT(st.first_name, ' ', st.last_name) AS staff_name

    ON o.staff_id = st.staff_id;

-- 2.  (Easy)  Show each product with its brand name and category name. Include products even if they have no brand or category assigned.
SELECT
    p.product_id,
    p.product_name,
    b.brand_name,
    c.category_name

---3.  (Medium)  Find all customers who have never placed an order. Return their name, city, and email.

FROM sales.customers c
LEFT JOIN sales.orders o
    ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_id IS NULL;

--GROUP BY
--4.  (Easy)  Calculate total revenue per store. Revenue = quantity * list_price * (1 - discount). Sort from highest to lowest.
SELECT
    s.store_id,
    s.store_name,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.list_price * (1 - oi.discount)) AS total_revenue
FROM sales.stores s
JOIN sales.orders o
    ON s.store_id = o.store_id
JOIN sales.order_items oi
    ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY
    s.store_id,
    s.store_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

--5.  (Medium)  For each brand, show the number of products, the average list price, and the highest list price. Only include brands with more than 5 products.
SELECT
    b.brand_id,
    b.brand_name,
    COUNT(p.product_id) AS number_of_products,
    AVG(p.list_price) AS average_list_price,

FROM production.brands b
JOIN production.products p
    ON b.brand_id = p.brand_id
GROUP BY
    b.brand_id,
    b.brand_name
HAVING COUNT(p.product_id) > 5;

--6.  (Medium)  Show the number of orders and total revenue per month for the year 2017, ordered chronologically.

SELECT
    MONTH(o.order_date) AS month_number,
    DATENAME(MONTH, o.order_date) AS month_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS number_of_orders,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.list_price * (1 - oi.discount)) AS total_revenue
FROM sales.orders o
JOIN sales.order_items oi
    ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
WHERE YEAR(o.order_date) = 2017
GROUP BY
    MONTH(o.order_date),
    DATENAME(MONTH, o.order_date)
ORDER BY month_number;

--SUBQUERIES

--7.  (Medium)  Find all products priced above the average list price of their own category.

SELECT
    p.product_id,
    p.product_name,
    p.category_id,
    p.list_price
FROM production.products p
WHERE p.list_price >
(
    SELECT AVG(p2.list_price)
    FROM production.products p2
    WHERE p2.category_id = p.category_id
);

--8.  (Medium)  List the customers who have placed more orders than the average number of orders per customer.

SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS number_of_orders
FROM sales.customers c
JOIN sales.orders o
    ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name
HAVING COUNT(o.order_id) >
(
    SELECT AVG(order_count)
    FROM
    (
        SELECT
            customer_id,
            COUNT(*) AS order_count
        FROM sales.orders
        GROUP BY customer_id
    ) AS customer_orders
);

--CTEs:

--9.  (Hard)  Using a CTE, calculate each customer's total spend, then return the top 10 customers with their spend and rank. 
   --Add a second CTE that labels each customer as "High" (above the overall average spend) or "Regular".

                THEN 'High'
            ELSE 'Regular'
        END AS customer_type
    FROM CustomerSpend

    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_spend DESC) AS customer_rank
FROM CustomerLabels
ORDER BY total_spend DESC;

--10.  (Hard)  Using CTEs, find the best-selling product (by quantity) in each category, and show how much of that product's stock is currently available across all stores.

WITH ProductSales AS

    SELECT
        p.product_id,
        p.product_name,

FROM RankedProducts rp
